# Roadmap for LinAV - Next-Gen Antivirus Engine for Linux

## Introduction
This document outlines the development roadmap for the next-generation antivirus software for Linux.

## Phase 1 : Dev : Core Development

### Tasks:

- [ ] **Implement real-time file scanning**
  - [ ] **File System Hooks**: Monitor file system events in real-time.
  - [ ] **Multi-threading**: Implement multi-threaded scanning to handle multiple files simultaneously.
  - [ ] **File Type Identification**: Use magic numbers and file signatures to identify file types and apply appropriate scanning techniques.
  - [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching mechanisms and efficient data structures to minimize scanning overhead.

- [ ] **Develop malware detection algorithms**
  - [ ] **Signature-Based Detection**: Create a database of known malware signatures and implement pattern matching algorithms to detect them.
  - [ ] **Heuristic Analysis**: Develop heuristic rules to identify suspicious behavior and potential zero-day threats.
  - [ ] **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor and analyze the behavior of running processes to detect anomalies indicative of malware.
  - [ ] **YARA Rules**: Develop and integrate YARA rules to identify and classify malware based on textual or binary patterns. Regularly update these rules to include new threat indicators.
  - [ ] **Threat Intelligence-Based Analysis**: Incorporate threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on the latest malware trends and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Use this information to enhance detection algorithms and improve response strategies.
  - [ ] **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of malware communication, such as unusual data transfers, connections to known malicious IP addresses, or command-and-control (C2) server communications.
  - [ ] **File Integrity Monitoring**: Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files and configurations, which may indicate malware presence.
  - [ ] **Memory Analysis**: Perform memory forensics to detect malware that resides in memory, such as fileless malware, which may not leave traces on the disk.
  - [ ] **System Call Analysis**: Monitor and analyze system calls made by processes to detect unusual or malicious activities. System call patterns can reveal the presence of malware attempting to exploit system resources or perform unauthorized actions.

- [ ] **Create a quarantine system for infected files**
  - [ ] **Isolation Mechanism**: Develop a secure method to move infected files to a quarantine directory, preventing further execution or access.
  - [ ] **User Notifications**: Implement a notification system to inform users when files are quarantined.
  - [ ] **Restoration and Deletion**: Provide options for users to restore files from quarantine (if false positive) or permanently delete them.
  - [ ] **Integrity Checks**: Ensure the integrity of quarantined files by using checksums or cryptographic hashes.

- [ ] **Implement logging and reporting mechanisms**
  - [ ] **Event Logging**: Log all significant events, including detections, quarantines, and user actions, with timestamps.
  - [ ] **Detailed Reports**: Generate detailed reports on scan results, including file paths, types of threats detected, and actions taken.
  - [ ] **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for viewing logs and reports, with filtering and search capabilities.
  - [ ] **Remote Logging**: Provide options to send logs to remote servers for centralized monitoring and analysis by EDR or similar solutions.
